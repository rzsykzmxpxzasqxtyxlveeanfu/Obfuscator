# Obfuscator
Protect your online privacy by obfustcating social media by the "deliberate use of ambiguous, confusing, or misleading information to interfere with surveillance and data collection projects" ([Obfuscation: A Userâ€™s Guide for Privacy and Protest] (https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/obfuscation), Nissenbaum & Brunton, 2015).

## Goal
In this case, the goal of obfuscation is to protect your (online) privacy. The goal of this tool is to collect data which can be used to automatically update many social media, so your profile gets obfuscated with data so the social media companies don't have a representative profile of you.
You can use obfuscation in combination with ad blocking, using VPN connections etc. Check [Privacytools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/) for more tips.

## Setup
The idea is to create an application anyone can host for himself, so you can manage your own sources, social media channels and other settings (language, region, update interval, etc). And, if your app is blocked by a social media company, it will not affect other deployments.

# Main functions
## 1: Collect data
The Obfuscator could periodically collect many different types of data:
* text from RSS feeds;
* links to pictures, e.g. from the [Flickr recent](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getRecent.htm) creative commons feed, for instance;
* links to video's from youtube search for a random word from a random RSS feed, for instance;
* GPS points and routes from [OpenStreetMap Traces](https://www.openstreetmap.org/traces);
* plain text users can paste from wherever;
* etc.

## 2: Obfuscate social media
The collected data can be used to:
* send e-mails to yourself with fony content;
* post video's to your timeline;
* update your photostream with pictures with and a random text (and emoticons);
* publish documents, spreadsheets to your online file storage and synchronization service;
* upload sports routes to your health trackers;
* join conversations as a chatbot;
* etc.
